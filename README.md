# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Motivation

I saw this landing page design [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8n4ha1AeCw/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link).

My goal was to learn animations with pure css, js (my first version was created with GSAP).\
The whole "app" is made responsive (looks ok from width: 540px) although the animations triggered by a wheel event ([e.deltaY](https://caniuse.com/?search=deltaY)), so it doesn't work on Safari.

## Animations:
